### Temporal Analysis: 
* Crime rates are explored over different time periods, including weekdays, weekends, and various hours of the day, to identify temporal patterns in criminal behavior.
### Policing Behavior: 
* The dataset is used to investigate policing behavior towards subjects, including the racial distribution of crime suspects and the types of force used by officers.
### Demographic Analysis:
* Racial and gender disparities within the police department are analyzed, highlighting the distribution of officers across different racial and gender groups.

### Temporal Patterns:
*Crime rates are found to be highest on Sundays at 3:00 am, with lower rates observed on Wednesdays during early morning hours.
### Policing Behavior:
* Black male subjects are disproportionately arrested compared to other racial groups, and verbal commands are the most common type of force used by officers.
### Racial Disparities:

### Gender Disparities:
* Male officers dominate the police force, with significantly fewer female officers, and male officers handle a much higher number of cases compared to female officers.
