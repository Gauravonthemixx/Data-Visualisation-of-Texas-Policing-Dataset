# 🚀 Data-Visualisation-of-Texas-Policing-Dataset

## :pencil: Description
The project focuses on analyzing the Dallas Policing dataset to gain insights into law enforcement practices, crime trends, and demographic patterns within the state of Texas. Through data visualization and exploration, the project aims to understand the distribution of crimes, policing behavior towards subjects, racial and gender disparities within the police department, and other relevant factors influencing law enforcement dynamics.



## ⌛ Data Exploration:


### Crime Trends: 
* The analysis begins by examining the overall major crime rate in Texas for 2016, with a specific focus on violent crimes and assaults on police officers.
### Temporal Analysis: 
* Crime rates are explored over different time periods, including weekdays, weekends, and various hours of the day, to identify temporal patterns in criminal behavior.
### Policing Behavior: 
* The dataset is used to investigate policing behavior towards subjects, including the racial distribution of crime suspects and the types of force used by officers.
### Demographic Analysis:
* Racial and gender disparities within the police department are analyzed, highlighting the distribution of officers across different racial and gender groups.
### Offender Characteristics: 
* The project delves into the characteristics of crime offenders, including their race, gender, and the types of offenses they are arrested for.

## 🖥️ Results:

### Temporal Patterns:
*Crime rates are found to be highest on Sundays at 3:00 am, with lower rates observed on Wednesdays during early morning hours.
### Policing Behavior:
* Black male subjects are disproportionately arrested compared to other racial groups, and verbal commands are the most common type of force used by officers.
### Racial Disparities:
* Black subjects are arrested more frequently than other racial groups, and the racial distribution of crime shows that Black individuals commit the majority of crimes.
### Gender Disparities:
* Male officers dominate the police force, with significantly fewer female officers, and male officers handle a much higher number of cases compared to female officers.
### Demographic Analysis:
* The majority of police officers are White males, with Hispanic males being the second-largest group, and female representation in the police force is relatively low.
